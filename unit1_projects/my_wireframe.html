		<p>Please see below for my wireframe for the index page.
		In short, the plan is to create a site as simple as possible 
		while giving user a viewing pleasure and ease to navigate. I 
		plan to make a side navigation bar, giving access to my 
		different social media site, and an extra page for more in
		depth introduction about myself. On the top left hand corner
		is an image of myself. In the middle of the site are boxes 
		divided by different weeks, and within the boxes are links 
		to different projects and blog-posts that I have for DBC.</p>
