<p>I believe the problem they are trying to solve is how to let people efficiently search for relelvent information in the vast indexes of pages on the internet.

<p>Blue Apron is a company that offer to deliver fresh cooking ingredients and receipts to people's door-step for an affordable price. Since their service is a relatively new concept and still in the early adoption stage, they need to utilize webpage technology as a gateway for users to understand their services and convinienty sign-up, manage the service.

<p>My third webpage is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com" target="blank">techcrunch.com</a></p>
<p>Techcrunch strive to be the best technology blogging site in the globe. Their challenge is that how to fit as many contents as possible on the homepage, while not making users feeling over-whelmed by the flood of information? They achieved this by designing a webpage that is able to show a list view of only topic and short summary of the articles, and fitting in 30+ articles in one page so users don't have to type or click antying in order to find more articles.</p>
