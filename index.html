    <p>Hi, I'm Stephens Xu, somewhat of a dreamer, technology enthusiast. I'm currently learning web development from <a href="http://www.quora.com/Jesse-Farmer" target="_blank">Jesse Farmer</a> and his <a href="http://codeunion.io" target="_blank">CodeUnion</a>. I graduated BA from University of California-Berkeley, in previous career I worked in Sales & Trading. After a string of life-changing events, I came to realize that my passion and future lies with Technology. Why? Because I want to be a builder, to make a difference in our world. As a start, I built <a href="http://couchfoodie.io" target="_blank">Couchfoodie.io</a>; a platform that allows people to socialize with cooking.</P>
