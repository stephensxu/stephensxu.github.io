Today I will talk about three of my favorite websites.

<h3><a href="http://www.google.com">google.com</a></h3>

Google is by far my favorite websites of all sites. Why? It is simple, elegant and the most useful thing on the net. It offers a user interface in the most simplest form possible while solving the most complex task: to answer our question in the most humble and honest way.

Google doesn't sell anything to me; the design of the website focuses simply on one thing: to help people acquire information. It focuses so much on how to let people search efficiently; it doesn't waste a single second of my time and offers straight forward answer as fast as possible. And most importantly, it just works. So how do I feel after spending countless hours with google? Love.

<p><h3><a href="http://www.blueapron.com">blueapron.com</a></h3></p>

Blue Apron is a company that offer to deliver fresh cooking ingredients and receipts to people's door-step for an affordable price. Again the website is simple, elegant, and straight to the point. It uses extremely high quality photograph do deliver their core message to the user: helping you to cook delicious meal at home. Their service is a relatively new concept, yet they used the site effectively to convey that message. Visitors' attention will be immediately drawn to the delicious looking food, the elegantly packaged ingredients and the $9.99 price tag. Bingo! The entire business model and service described in a few pictures. So how do I feel? Gotta give it a try!


<p><h3><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">techcrunch.com</a></h3></p>

Techcrunch is the most popular tech-blogging website in the World. There are many sites that offers similar information and services, however TC managed to stand-out exceptionally. The reason, at least in my opinion, is that it provides the best contents and it provide it in the most elegant way. Once again the website is simple, straight to the point. The page can be conveniently viewed as a list of tech topics, below the topic is a short summary of the article, and the site allows user to scroll down extensively, allowing display of many topics in one page.

The site design really focuses on how to let user view article topics, understand the core argument of the article, and move on to next topic without having to touch the mouse, type or click anything. If I want to read certain article in details, I can click in the specific article, otherwise I can view multiple article in a short period of time while still understanding the important information in that article. So how do I feel after spending time on the site? Happy and accomplished!
