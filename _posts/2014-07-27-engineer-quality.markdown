<h2><b>Be passionate about the things he builds, or at least care about the projects he contributes to.</b></h2>

There is no stronger driving force than passion and self-inspiration. Alright, I do admit that not everyone can love their job; but at the minimum the person should care about the project that he is working on. A talented and competent person can only do good work if he is WILLING to put his mind to it. Naturally, most individuals want to know they make a living doing something that create value, even if it only makes a tiny difference. The sense of accomplishment and self satisfaction will make him be responsible to their work, be innovative and have the willingness to constantly improve. 

<h2><b>Plays well with others, plays well with me, has sympathy.</b></h2>

Unless the person is about to work on a solo project, the only way he can bring value to the team is that he can actually be PART OF THE TEAM. It’s important to work well with machines, but it’s more important to work well with human. He has to able to communicate openly and effectively with colleagues. Collaboration is an important theme among software developers; if an individual is talented and possess rich technical knowledge, but cannot create synergy with teammates and generates negative atmosphere in the work space, he most likely destroy more value than he brings. More importantly, why would I want to hire someone that I can’t even have a conversation with and never gets my joke? 

<h2><b>Be honest and humble.</b></h2>

I don’t know about you, but I prefer to work with someone that’s honest, so I don’t have to waste my time trying to figure out whether he is telling the truth.

<h2><b>Understand the fundamentals of computer science.</b></h2>

This is a wild card. What is considered to be the “fundamentals”? Well, in theory, programming languages are just different ways to manipulate machines and give them commands. So at the minimum, he should understand how does computer interpret these commands; what kind of logic do the machines use to understand and make sense of these commands and data? For example, he should understand that regardless what data types and programming languages, everything eventually translate into combinations of “zeros” and “ones”, gets sent to the microprocessor for interpretation. Going up a level, he should understand what are the differences between the most basic data types? What are these data types? What are the basic operations we can perform on different data types? What are the different ways to enumerate data? How do computers communicate with each other? How do computers communicate with human? The list goes on. In summary, this person needs to understand how does computers "think", understand the full cycle of "networking", and able to apply these knowledge in different programming languages and technology framwork. Fundamentals are the foundation of technical know-how. If the foundations are built correctly, then there is a way to build upon it and the individual can learn new things. 

<h2><b>Has curiousity, has the capability and willingness to learn, and learns FAST.</b></h2>

Alright, if he is curious, cares about the project, wants to learn the trick, has good foundations, knows how to learn and plays well with others, we can probably couch him and have a little patience with this guy. Since he most likely will be a beginner and needs to play catch up, he must have the resilience and willingness to push for extra miles. With the right amount of curiosity, he needs to be asking the right questions and pick up new skills quickly and apply to day-to-day work. I believe curiousity is the key to self-inspired learning; for curious people, having an open mind to learn new skills is a rather fun experience rather than burdensome responsibility.

<h2><b>Gets the job done no matter what.</b></h2>

At end of the day, what I care the most is that I have someone to help me getting the project built successfully. This requires the individual to care about the project, so he has a sense of ownership to his part of work. If he can get the job done in 3 hours, great! But if deadline is approaching and the thing is still broken, get ready to cancel vacations and stock up red bulls! 

<h2><b>Knows how to tell a joke.</b></h2>

Okay, this one is probably just a bonus; but imagine the team working overnight and it's 11pm, everyone can use a good laugh :)

Now of course, everything above are just my personal opinions.
