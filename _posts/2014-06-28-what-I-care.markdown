I care about Technology, I care about how technology blend into average Joe's everyday life and help everyone to improve their lives and live happier.

 I think that's what technology is all about; to solve our problems, to improve our living standards, to make information accessible for everyone, expand our knowledge and ultimately to make humankind happier.

Some part of Silicon Valley has a misconception; people are so amused by the power of computers, that they believe every human should learn how technology works, to change our old habits, reinvent our lifestyles to we can better integrate with the newest tech. How many times have you heard someone say: "That's a really good product, people don't like it because they are not smart enough to understand, learn and use it."

I believe that's wrong; technology should never create more problem for our lives. If anything, computers should learn how HUMAN works and blend in OUR LIVES seamlessly. I think that's one of the most decisive factor for a technology product or service to succeed. User experience should have always been the priority, because the ultimate goal is to make users happy, not frustrate them with uncomfortable factors. Apple products are incredibly popular because, put it in a simple way, they make me happy when I use them.

I believe there are countless brilliant technology being invented on a daily base; but how do we make them work with human so they can make real impact? How do we get everyone to accept and be comfortable with all the seemingly mind-blowing "new stuff" coming out of silicon valley every day? I hope someday I would be contributing to make that possible.
