My name is Stephens Xu, somewhat of a dreamer, technology enthusiast. I'm currently learning web development from Jesse Farmer and John Davison. I graduated BA from University of California-Berkeley, in my previous career I worked in the Sales & Trading industry. After a string of life-changing events, I came to realize that my passion and future lies with Technology. Why? Because I want to be a builder, to make a small difference in the world we live in.
